# Kendo UI Core jQuery Boilerplate

A Kendo UI Core jQuery Boilerplate to get you started.

### Prerequisities

Install or Update [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org/)

Once you have Node.js/npm working open a terminal and install [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally by running:

```
> npm install bower -g
```

### Installing

Clone this repository or download a ZIP. Discard all other boilerplates except the one you want to use.

Open the boilerplate directory you want to use in your terminal.

Run the following terminal commands:

```
> npm install
```

Then run:

```
> bower install
```

This will install the required [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) packages.

### Running

Open a terminal from the boilerplate directory (i.e. core-jquery).

Run the following [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) commands:

```
> npm run dev-server
```

This will open the `index.html` page at localhost:4000 using [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/). Browsersync has been setup to reload after any changes to any `.html`, `.css`, or `.js `files in the `dev-server` directory.
